# Socket.io enables realtime Bi-Directional event based communication for example:
- express allows the client to send a request to a server | But the server cannot send a request to the client.
So In express There Does not have any bi-directional communication.

Socket.io Solves this problem. Coz we can push notification from the server to the client when any event happens.

Socket.io has two parts : 
- Client Side Library [That Runs inside the web browser]
- Server Side Library [That Runs from NODEJS]

Both Component have an API that is almost identical and event driven.

SocketIo is a web Socket library
